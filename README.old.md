# 📚 SpaceBooks

**SpaceBooks** is a collaborative creative writing platform where authors co-write stories one paragraph at a time. Each writer contributes a timed paragraph, and the group votes on whether it gets included — ensuring stories evolve through collective creativity.

## 🚀 Demo Version Features (MVP)

- Choose from prewritten plots and genres
- 3 writers per story (to keep voting outcomes always uneven)
- Timed writing turns (2–10 minutes)
- In-app voting: 2 Yes vs 1 No = Keep it, 2 No vs 1 Yes = Reject
- Leaderboards and profiles for top writers
- First paragraph (intro) is non-votable and always written by the story creator

- **Hosting**: Vercel or Firebase Hosting
